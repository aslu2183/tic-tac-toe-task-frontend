# Getting Started

## Step 1: Install Dependencies


```bash
# using npm
npm install

```

## Step 2: Replace .env.example to .env

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: To Run application

```bash
# using npm
npm run dev

```
